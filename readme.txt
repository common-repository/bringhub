== Description ==

The Bringhub Native Commerce Unit (NCU) is an all-in-one context analysis and ad display widget that blends seamlessly with your content.

Powered by Bringhub’s propriety Sweeten process, the NCU analyzes each post to decipher context, then finds and displays the most relevant product ads — helping you monetize your site while serving visitors ads they actually want to see.

Machine learning algorithms monitor each unique placement to continuously improve performance — and continuously increase your ad earnings.

**Bringhub Highlights:**
* Built with AI technology, Sweeten analyzes the text and images of every post to match highly relevant product ads.
* The NCU is automatically inserted at the bottom of each post.
* Fully responsive widget renders perfectly on any device.
* Choose your own custom headline and layout of up to 20 tiles (ads) per placement.
* Style with native CSS to flawlessly fit your site’s look and feel.
* Insert additional units (or hide the unit) on any post with the click of a button.
* Product discovery for your visitors + Revenue for you = Win/Win
